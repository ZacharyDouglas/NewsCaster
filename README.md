# NewsCaster

NewsCaster is a website designed to migrate news from the New York Times API based on the users preferences and demonstrate my ability to work with MySQL, Javascript, JQuery, PHP, CSS, and HTML technologies.

A user has the ability to make an account. Inside their profile, they're able to select attributes for news that they find desirable. 

The user's preferences are saved to their profile.  From there, I used JQuery/Javascript to call the New York Times API to find news articles that are related to their desired preferences and selected time frame.
